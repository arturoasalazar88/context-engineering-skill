## Progress Log

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-02-14 | Story created from BUG-001 incomplete tasks |

## Decisions Made

None yet.

## Blockers

- Blocked by Story 001 (test BUG-001 fix first to ensure update process works)

## Context Engineering Compliance

- [x] Story file uses structured format (checklists, tables, YAML)
- [x] No credentials in story file
- [x] Acceptance criteria are clear and measurable
- [x] Memory layer identified (Working Memory - Layer 2)
- [x] New files follow CONTEXT-SCHEMA.yaml placement rules
- [x] Token budget impact assessed (~1,500 tokens per-task)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] /context-update command is fully documented
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples
- [ ] Documentation explains backup and rollback
- [ ] Documentation covers merge strategies
- [ ] Users can understand and use the command from docs alone
- [ ] Documentation added to appropriate location (README or commands-reference.md)

## Outcome

[To be filled when completed]
