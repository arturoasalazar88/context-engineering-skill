    description: |
      The /context-start command did not scan or report on context/workflows/ files.
      This caused agents to violate mandatory workflow rules because they were unaware
      of workflows marked with 🔒 MANDATORY or 🔒 INVIOLABLE.

    impact:
      - "Agents violated mandatory workflow rules"
      - "Missed critical context during session start"
      - "Token inefficiency from not using proper delegation"

    solution: |
      Added Step 3 to /context-start: Scan workflows directory, detect mandatory
      markers, auto-load mandatory workflows, and list available workflows.

          - section: "total_context_budget.mandatory_workflows"
            detection: "mandatory_workflows: 3000"

    verification:
      - "Run /context-start in project"
      - "Verify 'Mandatory workflows' section appears if workflows exist"
      - "Verify workflows with 🔒 markers are auto-loaded"
      - "Verify token budget includes mandatory workflow count"
